# FOXBLOCKS - Blockstuff?, Items?, Props? You want it? It's yours my friend!
## FoxBlocks is a Minecraft Mod that, like the many mods along side it, adds a trainload of decorative building blocks- bricks, planks, tarmac, and so much more. Did I mention the mod also adds a whole set of Props to help build with? The set of modular bridge parts for railroad bridges? Maybe even the Traincraft compatible modular overhead wires? Maybe even the work in progress "smart" road paints or modular bathroom stall wall parts? This mod has a little bit of everything, from the generic to the specific!

### Some of the mods highlights:
-Forge Multiblock Support
-Vast array of building blocks such as bricks, planks, Aperture Science brand Panels, sheet metals, tiles, the list goes on
-Slightly less vast array of decorative props such as fancy industrial lamps, a toilet, steel coils, railroad signage, ect
-Extra Vast array of railroad related modular props such as Overhead Wires (for traincraft), modular bridge pillar parts, ect
-Some various other little funnies
